## Names of Packages

What packages have we used so far in all of our documents? Please go back to your previous documents and look through them. 


## Function and Package Matching

On your cheat sheets you have the functions that we learned. 
For each function that we have learned so far, note down the package that the function is from in the following fashion:

`package_name::function_name()`

Do not write this in a chunk though as we do not to execute these functions.

ggplot2::ggplot() 
ggplot2:aes()
base::mean()
